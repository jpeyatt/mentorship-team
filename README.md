# Node.js Mentorship Program

As a front end developer, for the past few years, I've had the opportunity develop skills in JavaScript/TypeScript and have grown to love the language (quirks and all)! 
I would now like to take these skills and apply them to building backend applications via Node.js. I think the Mentorship Program would be the perfect place for me to help out with the skills I've obtained, learn about the Node.js ecosystem from awesome engineers, and contribute to an amazing open source project used all around the world. 
The opportuntiy sounds really exciting and I would love to join!
